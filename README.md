###Potential Correlations between Risk Behaviors and Cervical Cancer</br></br>
<b>Objective:</b> The goal of this project is to find any correlations that may exist between one's habits and Cervical Cancer, and possibly the kind of the tumor as well. I will need to clean the data and extract useful data from the datasets, look for correlations among attributes and draw a conclusion of what I may find. Visualization will also be used to present the results.</br></br>

<b>Background:</b>
	It is important for me to solve this problem because it may benefit in the sense of raising people's awareness about cancers and behavior risks. It is personal important to me as I would like to learn more about cancers in general and Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma in particular. This is for my family member, relatives and people who have been suffering from the diseases.</br></br>

<b>Solution Overview:</b></br>
